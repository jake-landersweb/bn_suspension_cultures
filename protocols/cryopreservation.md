# Cryo Preservation Protocol

## Materials

- Pre-treatment Media
  - 100mL of culture media.
  - 18g of manitol.
  - Adjust pH to 5.8-6.0 with HCl or KOH.
  - Autoclave.
  - Store in the dark.

- Cryo-preservation Media
  - 68.5g sucrose in 40mL water.
  - In warm wide-mouth glass pipette, pour 7.23mL hot (60C) glycerol.
  - Fill with water until final volume of 93mL.
  - Autoclave.
  Aseptically add 7.1mL DMSO and 2.5mL filter sterilized L-proline (40%).
  - Store at 4C in dark.

## Preculture 1

- Treat cells with half liquid growth media and half cryo pre-treatment media.

- Concentration of saccharide from pre-treatment media of 0.3-0.5

- Incubate cells for 2 days.

## Preculture 2

- Treat cells with full cryo pre-treatment media.

- Incubate for 1 day, 2 days max.

## Freezing

- Fill Nalgene Mr. Frosty with 250mL isoporpynol (or ethanol) and place at 4C overnight

- Place flask of cells on ice.

- Remove all media from flask, and measure volume.

- Replace same volume of fluid with cro-preservation media.

- Shake on ice for 40-60 minutes.

- Fill 2mL cryo epi-tubes with 1.8mL of cell-cryo-fluid into each vial rapidly, and place in Mr. Frosty.

- Place Mr. Frosty into -80C for 2-4 hours.

- Remove tubes, and dunk in liquid nitrogen for 2-4 hours.

- Place cells inside bag with a small amount of liquid nitrogen and store indefinitely.

## Thawing

- Remove cells from freezer, placing directly on ice.

- Place cell epi-tubes in 35-40C water until thawed.

- Put cell epi-tubes directly back on ice.

- Wipe all surfaces and epitubes with 100% ethanol.

- While wearing gloves, unscrew epi tubes and pipette contents into flask containing regular media.

- transfer all cells into a pre-weighed 2mL epi tube

- remove all liquid from the epi tube, and weigh again.

- place all contents of epi tube into flask containing 10mL cryo pre-treatment media

- Allow cells to aclimate for 2 days

- Exchange media for 5mL normal media and 5mL cryo pre-treatment media

- Let cells aclimate for another 2 days

- Exchange media for completely normal media

- Let cells sit for a week

- re-weight the cells using the same method from above.
