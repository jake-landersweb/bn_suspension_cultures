# Transformation of cells

1. Transforation vector starter culture incubates overnight

2. 100ul of starter culutre + 100mL of media overnight

3. Transfer mixture into large centerfugal tubes and spin at 4000rmp for 10 min

4. remove media from pellet and saturate pellet in 1mL of cell medium

5. get OD600 reading from the cells using either a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution

6. 0.5 concentration into cells with 10mL of medium + 40uL of acetosyringone for every 10mL of medium

## Maintenence

After 48 hours change media for media containing antibiotic selection media.
> In this case, TIM

After another 48 hours, change media for media containing both antibiotics and transformed cell selection hormones.
> TIM + HYG
