## Goal

Develop a robust cell transformation protocol that provides the ability to rapidly test cell constructs in a primary model that can be transitioned to actual plants. In theory, compared to traditional method of hypocoyl transformation this should be a 10x speed improvement in testing DNA constructs for plant cell transformation.

## About

Brassica Napus cells are kept in suspension in a liquid media containing sugars, vitamins, and phytohormones vital for plant cell life. These cells are genetically similar (not identical due to 30 years of genetic mutations) to Brassica Napus, also known as Canola. The cells are transfored using agrobacterium containing custom designed DNA vectors that infect the plant cells and integrate their plasmid into the host's chromosomes. The transformation protocol worked on takes around 30 days to develop stable, transformed cell cultures.
